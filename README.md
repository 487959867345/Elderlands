ELDERLANDS - The mod that may corrupt your mind and your game

Here be dragons - This mod is very very very very early in developement and probably won't even run. If it does, that is a insane. Possibly think twice about putting this mod in your modpack UNTILL it is in at least alpha. If you are a daredevil, then proceed ðŸ˜‰

------------------ Description -------------------------- 

Elderlands is a mod designed to make Minecraft's "adventure" aspect more of an adventure. This mod currently adds blocks and items... Well, it is only a few days old :p. We plan on making an entire dimension where slaying the bosses is your goal. The Elderlands is a chaotic dimension at the end of the game. You must to beat 5 minibosses to get 5 different relics to open the Elder Portal. Basically, the more time your spend in the ElderLands, the more inhumane you become. You slowly start loosing sanity. Then you have to beat the big boss in the Elderlands. (Its name hasn't yet been created). If you fail to beat him, the Elderlands slowly seeps into the other dimensions, consuming anything in its path with evil
